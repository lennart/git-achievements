Git-Achievements records all of the achievements you acquire while using Git.

There are over 40 achievement, most with different levels to be achieved.
After a git command is executed if a new achievement is unlocked
git-achievements will display a message on the console for your enjoyment:

********************************************************************************
                            Git Achievement Unlocked!                            

                                    Caretaker                                    
                    Added a .gitignore file to a repository.

GitHub Pages
------------

A log of all of your achievements is kept locally, but you can also publish
it to GitHub pages so you can share your achievements (and there is a rss
feed so people can track your achievements).

For example here is mine: http://icefox.github.com/git-achievements

To push your achievements to GitHub first fork the project on GitHub,
clone *your* repository and set the following config to true:

git config --global achievement.upload "true"

When an achievement is unlocked the index.html file will be overwritten,
committed and then a 'git push origin' will be executed.


Install
-------
Add git-achievements to your path and alias git to git-achievements

For example add the following to the end of your ~/.bash_profile

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/git/git-achievements"
alias git="git-achievements"

You can get your first achievement by running

    git achievements --help
